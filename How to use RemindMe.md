You can add a new reminder by pressing the "Add Reminder" button

You can then fill in the  details of your reminder. You can select the reminder to popup daily,during work days only, weekly, monthly, or just once

# How will it look when it pops up?
When an reminder pops up, it will always be on top. This is very affective because you will always notice it.

However, if you don't want it to interrupt whatever it is you're doing, you can go to the settings by clicking the cog in the bottom right corner, and click the windows button. There you can select it to be minimized. It will make a sound if you added it to the reminder, but it will only show up in the taskbar. You won't see it until you click it
