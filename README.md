# RemindMe
RemindMe is a windows desktop application that will notify you of events that you created using this application.

I Have rewritten RemindMe because i wasn't happy with the way certain things were coded. 
I think it is much cleaner now. It also resulted in some new features it didn't have before

You can install RemindMe by downloading the installer and running it.

RemindMe lurks in the windows system tray and will not show itself until you double click the icon, or right click it and select show RemindMe

You can also exit RemindMe this way, or go to the settings without opening RemindMe
