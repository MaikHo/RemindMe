//RemindMe has been rewritten from the ground up because the code wasn't neccesarely messy, but i really wasn't happy with the way it was coded.

(14-4-2017) V1.0.0 -  First release of the completely rewritten RemindMe.
(14-4-2017) V1.0.1 -  Reminders will now be sorted in the listview. Earliest date will be the first in the list
(15-4-2017) V1.0.2 -  Newly made reminders are placed correctly in the listview depending on their date, rather than always at the end.
(15-4-2017) V.1.0.3 - Fixed some first use issues when trying to read files that don't exist
(21-5-2017)V.1.1.0 -  New feature: You can now make reminders repeat every x days. i.e. every 3 days
(21-5-2017)V1.1.01 -  Increased the limit on repeating reminders every x days from 100 to 1000
(23-5-2017)V1.1.2  -  Fixed an issue where duplicate objects were made and shown in the listview / The create form will now be filled when you press edit on an reminder with an repeat type of every x days
(24-5-2017)V1.1.21 -  Unhandled exceptions will now not show the default windows popup, but our custom ErrorPopup instead. It will also write the error to the errorlog.
(24-5-2017)V1.1.22 -  Polished up the custom error form. It wil now use an untargetable-readonly textbox to display the text. The error form now has its own icon
(24-5-2017)V1.1.23 -  RemindMe now has a new icon
(25-5-2017)V1.1.24 -  Sound icon in the settings has been changed. When the user loads the settings, the music tab will load by default
(26-5-2017)V1.1.3 -   RemindMe now has a custom version of the default MessageBox. used by calling RemindMeBox.Show()
				      You can now change the name of an existing reminder. Previously it would create a new reminder
(27-5-2017)V1.2  -    RemindMe has been rewritten to now use SQLite to store reminders and settings. 
(5-6-2017)V1.3.0 - 
-previously, when a reminder is set to less than today, it will show the date of the reminder(in the past), but when it's today, it will show the time.
It now shows time when it is less than today aswell.

-Reminders can now be postponed.

-The reminder listview will now be updated after you close the reminder popup form. This is because reminders will now be updated after you close to popup

-Fixed a bug where the date of an newly made (weekly)reminder would be an week in the future even if the selected time is larger than the current time
i.e. an user creates a reminder every thursday at 11:00am(selected), and at the time of creation it is thursday, 10:50 pm(current).
The first reminder should then be in 10 minutes, not in a week and 10 minutes

(6-6-2017)V1.3.1 - Fixed a small bug where non-repeating reminders were deleted instantly,
so they couldn't be postponed. They are now temporarily set to disabled like the other reminders

(7-6-2017)V1.3.2 
-If you postponed a reminder, it will now show the date of the postponedate in the listview, and will show its date with an (p) which means postponed
-Updated the create if not exists SQLite table query

(10-6-2017)V1.4.0
-Reminders can now be repeated at custom. 
custom: every x minutes,hours,days,weeks, or months. i.e. every 4 hours, or every 2 weeks

(10-6-2017)V1.4.1
Fixed a small problem where the date timepicker would not update when you change the time. 
If it's 2:00 am, and you select the reminder time to be 1:00am and on the same weekly/monthly date as today, it should not set it to today, but to the next week/month instead

(11-6-2017)V1.4.11
Reminders will now be read from the database once on start, and everytime the database changes.
Every tick of the timer a local cached reminder list will be read, instead of connecting with the database every tick of the timer, which is now the case because the database is local(SQLite), because of this it doesn't matter that much, but it's good practise.

(13-6-2017)V1.4.2
-New feature: Sticky form. Sticky form will save the values in the reminder form, so that when you create a new reminder, the fields will still have the data
from the previous edited/created reminder. Toggleable

(15-6-2017) - Fixed a small issue where RemindMe was trying to check something from the database, even if you do not have a sqlite database file yet

(20-6-2017) - -Fixed an issue when postponing a reminder. 
The list that was checked in the timer_tick wasn't being updated,but that list isnt being used anymore with this update

-Created a new list of reminders that is only being refreshed when the database changes to minimize the amount of database calls. 
Even though this doesn't really matter since SQLite a local database, it's good practise

-Fixed an issue where the default value of the first datetimepicker was set to somewhere in 2016, if the sticky form setting was set to true. 
it now defaults to today.

(4-7-2017)V1.5.0 - Big update.
-Reminders can now be repeated at multiple days. Example: every monday,friday and sunday.
Reminders that have this repeating type will show their repeating type in RemindMe's main listview as the first 3 letters of the day. Example: mon,fri,sun
The interface has been altered to work with this new feature. When selecting "Multiple days" a new panel will show with checkboxes for monday-sunday
The SQlite database has been altered to work with this new feature. there is a new column called RepeatDays wich will contain the comma seperated string of days. Example "monday,friday,sunday"
Updated the CreateDatabaseIfNotExist() queries for creating tables, so that the tables contain all the columns it should have.

-RemindMe now checks if the user's .db file has all the columns with the DLReminders.HasColumn() method. if the user has an outdated .db file, new columns will be inserted with DLReminders.InsertNewcolumns();

-Changed the way RemindMe inserts new reminders. Previously, there were multiple(too much) overload methods for different reminders(different method for weekly,monhtly,custom, etc).
There is now óne InsertReminder() method that inserts the reminder into the database, with nullable parameters. Inside this method there will be checked if the parameters are null with .HasValue()

-RemindMe now catches more exceptions in Program.cs.
Whenever there is an uncaught exception, the Application_ThreadException in program.cs will check the exception type (FileNotFoundException,SQLiteException,PathTooLongException etc) and will pop up RemindMe's custom ErrorPopup form with an message.

-Changed the way RemindMe places controls when selecting different repeating types(note textbox will be below the monthly combobox if it is visible, below the repeating radiogroup if not)
Instead of changing the locations on the checked_changed events, the controls now use their own visible_changed and location_changed event.
example: tbNote_LocationChanged. Whenever, however, the location of tbNote changes, the 3 buttons below it will be given a new location aswell(always below the textbox)

(5-7-2017)
V 1.5.01 - Small update  
-When selecting one or multiple checkboxes when te multiple days radiobutton is selected, RemindMe will now automatically give the date for the next earliest day from the selected days

-The day checkboxes now all share one custom event, cbDaysCheckedChangeEvent. They still have the original checked_changed event, of course.
The earliest selected day will be calculated here, and then BLDateTime will calculate the date for that day.

-The checkboxes will now clear too when the reminder form clears

(7-7-2017)V1.5.02
-Refactored some code that didn't belong in BLIO and moved it to an method in DLReminder instead

-Refactored the weekly type of reminder. removed it since there's now the weekdays option where the user can select multiple week days, so only one, too. 
This has the same functionality as the previous "weekly" reminder

(10-7-2017)V1.5.03

-Reminders can now be previewed by right clicking the reminder and selecting:
*Preview this reminder now
*Preview this reminder in 5 seconds
*Preview this reminder in 10 seconds

-Removed the ReminderManager class, as it has been stripped down to only 1 method in the past. Changed the only remaining method SetNextReminderWorkDay to
BLDateTime.GetNextReminderWorkDay(Reminder) which gives the next workday date of the given reminder

 -Changed the DLSongs class to work with a local list like the DLReminder class

 -Fixed an issue where the textbox wasn't placed below the radio button groupbox when the day checkboxes panel was invisible. 
 This happened when you pressed the back button while having the radio button weekdays selected, and then pressing the Add reminder button again.

 (15-7-2017)V1.5.04
 Gave the context menu strip a gray-white theme, to match the theme of RemindMe

 Added a new method SaveAndCloseDataBase() to DLReminder. This simply saves and disposes the database, but also refreshes the local list. 
 Everytime when the database needs saving, instead of calling RemindMeDbEntities.SaveChanges, we call this method. Then, the local cache list also gets updated.

 fixed a small bug where if you pressed the "x" button on a reminder preview popup, it would say that the reminder doesn't exist(because the id is -1, and that doesn't exist in the database)

 (18-7-2017)V1.5.05
 Added unit tests to RemindMe for the following classes:
 (Business Logic Layer)
 -BLDateTime
 -BLIO
 (Data Access Layer)
 -DLReminders
 -DLSettings
 -DLSongs

 Made changes to ComboBoxItemManager to be more OOP-Friendly. The comboboxitem list method GetComboboxItems() now returns a ReadOnly version of the list.
 this way it can't be changed. If the list needs changing however, the new methods AddComboboxItem(), RemoveComboboxItem() and ClearComboboxItems() can be used

 Changed the DLSettings class to work with a local variable with database information, like the DLSongs and DLReminder classes.

 Removed the remaining DayOfWeek parameter from InsertReminder() as this is no longer needed, because weekly reminders are no longer a thing.

 Prevented multiple instances of the settings form by checking if it is already open

 Changed the BLDateTime.GetNextReminderWorkDay() method to give the next work day of that reminder. 
 Previously it would get the first friday if the next workday of that reminder would be friday. It now returns the next friday based of the date of the reminder.
 If the reminder's date is in Thursday April 6th, 2017 the next workday will be Friday April 7th, 2017, in stead of the next friday based on the current time.
 Because of this change the GetNextReminderWorkDay() now uses a while loop to keep adding days until the next work day is larger than DateTime.Now

 (19-7-2017)V1.5.06
 Added a few more unit tests to DLReminders

 The settings form is now no longer being used. The cog(settings) button on the "home screen" of RemindMe will now load the new settings panel.
 This way there will be now new windows created, but everything will be in the same RemindMe window. Any setting logic has not been altered, as the logic is contained
 in user controls. these user controls simply get loaded into the panels in the settings panel

 (19-7-2017)V1.5.07 - Minor change
 Made the settings panel more visually appealing
