//RemindMe has been rewritten from the ground up because the code wasn't neccesarely messy, but i really wasn't happy with the way it was coded.

(14-4-2017) V1.0.0 - First release of the completely rewritten RemindMe.
(14-4-2017) V1.0.1 - Reminders will now be sorted in the listview. Earliest date will be the first in the list
(15-4-2017) V1.0.2 - Newly made reminders are placed correctly in the listview depending on their date, rather than always at the end.
