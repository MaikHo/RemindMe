# How will it look when it pops up?
When an reminder pops up, it will always be on top. This is very affective because you will always notice it.

If you want to be reminded of the same reminder a little bit later, click the postpone checkbox, fill in an amount and select minutes, or hours. Then simply press the button

However, if you don't want it to interrupt whatever it is you're doing, you can go to the settings by clicking the cog in the bottom right corner.

You can add, or remove sound effects to the list of RemindMe by pressing the sound icon in the yellow square like shown on this image
